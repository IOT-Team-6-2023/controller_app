# The controller_app
> This app controls the RPi Controller's functions.

## Installation Instructions

This app is a simple relay server that coordinates actions between IoT Devices and a cloud-hosted web API service.  
Run the following commands to get the app up and running on an RPi (we installed Ubuntu 22.04 on the RPi).

```bash
sudo apt install npm -y
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IOT-Team-6-2023/controller_app.git
cd controller_app
```
```bash
npm init -y
npm install
```
```bash
node .
```
